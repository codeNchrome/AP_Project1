Yahtzee (Yacht - Yatzy is a public domain dice
 game similar to Yacht and Yahtzee. Players take
 turns rolling five dice. After each roll,
 the player chooses which dice to keep,
 and which to reroll. A player may reroll 
some or all of the dice up to two times on a turn. 
The player must put a score or zero into a 
score box in each turn. The game ends when all

Centennial Dice Game --Centennial

Also known as Ohio and Martinetti.  
This game is played with three dice and requires
 a simple board consisting of a row of 12 numbered
 squares which can be drawn on a piece of paper.  
Players must record their positions on this board 
by using either counters, initials, or 
distinguishable coins as markers.
Play:
The aim of this game is to move from 1 on the board, 
up to 12, and then back to 1 again, in sequence. 
 Each player in turn throws three dice and moves 
to square 1 if the throw contains a 1.  
To move to square 2 the throw must contain
 either a 2 or two 1s, and to move to square 3 
the throw must contain either a 3, three 1s, 
or a 2 and a 1, and so on.  The value of any single
 die, the sum of any two, and the sum of all
 three may be counted.

A player can move more than one place in any single
 turn by using more than one combination of dice 
values.  For example, if a player on their first 
throw rolls a 1, 2, and a 4, they may use the 1 
to move to position 1 on the board; the 2 takes
 them to position 2; the 2 and 1 together to 
position 3; the 4 to position 4; the 4 and 1 
to position 5; the 4 and 2 to position 6; 
and the sum of the 1, 2 and 4 takes them to 
position 7.

A player may also move if an opponent overlooks
 a number that they require.  In this case, 
any other player, requiring the same number, 
may claim it, as long as they do so as soon
 as the dice are passed on.

The winner is the first player to make the
 round trip from position 1 to 12 and back 
to 1 again.

Variations:
Additionally, a player may be allowed an extra
 throw every time they are successful in moving
 their marker.
